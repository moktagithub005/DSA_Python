    "Note on Base Case: The provided text mentions \"If it is less than equal to one, then of course Fibonacci number we used to take as one else we use to return N minus one and n minus two th number.\" This implies fib(0) returns 0 and fib(1) returns 1. If the base case explicitly returns 1 for n <= 1, then fib(0) would be 1, which is not standard. Assuming the standard definition F(0)=0, F(1)=1, the code return n for n <= 1 correctly handles this. The analysis will hold regardless of specific base values, as long as there are two recursive calls.\n",

    "This exponential growth is why this recursive implementation is highly inefficient for calculating larger Fibonacci numbers. It recomputes the same Fibonacci numbers many, many times (e.g., fib(n-3) is computed multiple times in the tree). This inefficiency is a classic example of why dynamic programming or memoization is often introduced to optimize such problems, by storing previously computed results and avoiding redundant calculations."
