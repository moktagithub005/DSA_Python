    "To find the Big O time complexity, we consider the worst-case scenario. For Bubble Sort, the worst case occurs when the array is sorted in decreasing order (e.g., [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]). In this scenario, every adjacent pair will be in the wrong order, and swaps will occur in almost every comparison, forcing the algorithm to perform the maximum number of operations.\n",
