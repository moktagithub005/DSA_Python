    "#Deriving the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of the recurrence relation method is to express the time complexity of a problem of size N, denoted as T(N), in terms of the time complexity of smaller subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the Base Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "When n == 0, the function simply returns 1. This involves a constant amount of work. Let's represent this as K_0.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, T(0)=K_0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the Recursive Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "When n > 0, the function performs a few operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "It executes the else block.\n",
    "\n",
    "It performs a multiplication (n * ...). This is a constant-time operation. Let's call this K_mult.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes a recursive call to factorial(n - 1). The time taken for this call is T(N−1).\n",
    "\n",
    "It also includes other constant operations like function call overhead, variable access, and return statement. Let's group all these constant operations (including K_mult) into a single constant K.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for N0, the total time T(N) can be expressed as:\n",
    "T(N)=K+T(N−1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation, T(N)=K+T(N−1), with the base case T(0)=K_0, is our recurrence relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the Recurrence Relation (Substitution Method)\n",
    "Now, we expand the recurrence relation by repeatedly substituting the terms until we identify a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have:\n",
    "T(N)=K+T(N−1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute T(N−1) using the same relation (T(N−1)=K+T(N−2)):\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=K+(K+T(N−2))\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=2K+T(N−2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute T(N−2) using the same relation (T(N−2)=K+T(N−3)):\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=2K+(K+T(N−3))\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=3K+T(N−3)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a pattern emerging. After i substitutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=iK+T(N−i)\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue this substitution until we reach the base case, where N−i=0, which means i=N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute i=N:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=NK+T(N−N)\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=NK+T(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, substitute the value of T(0) from our base case analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=NK+K_0\n",
    "\n",
    "Deriving Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for T(N) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)=NK+K_0\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation shows that the total time taken is a linear function of N.\n",
    "In Big O notation, we focus on the dominant term (the term that grows fastest with N) and ignore constant factors and lower-order terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term NK is the dominant term, as it grows linearly with N.\n",
    "\n",
    "K and K_0 are constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, ignoring the constant K and K_0:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "approxN\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the time complexity of the recursive factorial algorithm is O(N) (Linear Time Complexity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition Behind O(N) for Factorial\n",
    "Even though there are no explicit loops in the code, the recursive calls themselves form a \"hidden loop.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "factorial(N) calls factorial(N-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "factorial(N-1) calls factorial(N-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "factorial(1) calls factorial(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "This chain of calls creates N+1 function calls (from N down to 0). Each function call performs a constant amount of work (comparison, multiplication, return). Since there are N+1 calls, and each does constant work, the total work is proportional to N.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the time complexity is linear, O(N), even without an explicit for or while loop in the code."
