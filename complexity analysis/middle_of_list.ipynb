    "1. Time Complexity \n",
    "î€ \n",
    "= Time Taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker starts by reiterating a crucial point: \"Time complexity is not equal to time taken.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that while an algorithm might take a certain amount of real-world time to run on a specific machine with a specific input, time complexity is a more abstract measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity focuses on the rate of growth of operations as the input size changes, rather than the absolute time. Factors like processor speed, programming language, and other processes running on the computer can influence \"time taken,\" but they don't change the fundamental time complexity of an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Problem: Finding the Middle of a List/Array:\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Determine how the time taken to find the middle element of a list or array changes with respect to the input size (n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Size Examples: The speaker provides examples of different list sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 1 million\n",
    "\n",
    "n = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analysis of Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is that to find the middle of a list, you typically need to know its length (which is usually n in most programming contexts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the length n, finding the middle element is a simple arithmetic operation: n / 2 (or (n-1)/2 for 0-indexed arrays and even lengths, or similar variations depending on the exact definition of \"middle\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight here is that this division operation is a single, constant-time operation. It doesn't matter if n is 100 or 1 million; the division operation itself still takes the same amount of \"work\" or \"steps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The speaker states, \"the operations which I have to do, that is not actually getting changed or getting any affected by the length.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "They refer to this as \"some K operations\" or \"some k operations,\" implying a fixed number of elementary steps regardless of n. Even if there's an additional operation to return the value, it's still a fixed number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Relating to Big O Notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant Work: Since the number of operations is fixed and doesn't depend on n, it can be represented as a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Representation: The speaker writes n^0, which simplifies to 1. This is a common way to express a constant in the context of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O Definition: The speaker briefly alludes to the definition of Big O notation (though not explicitly writing it out in full). In Big O notation, we look for an upper bound on the growth rate. If the number of operations is bounded by a constant K, then it's considered O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: \"So on that note, what I think is that to find out your overall middle, you will be doing some K work... So that is actually independent of your input size. So I can maybe write it n to the power zero right. Which is going to be one finally... If this is the case, then of course I can very comfortably say that complexity is big O of one or N to the power zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"Constant Time Operation\":\n",
    "\n",
    "The final conclusion is that finding the middle of a list or array is a constant time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means its time complexity is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It does not get affected by your input size.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the core argument is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you typically know the length of a list/array (or can get it in constant time), calculating its middle index simply involves a constant number of arithmetic operations (like division). This number of operations remains the same regardless of how large the list is. Therefore, the time complexity is constant, denoted as O(1)."
