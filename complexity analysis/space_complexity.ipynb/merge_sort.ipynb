    "Merge Sort: Revisited for Space Complexity\n",
    "Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It recursively divides an array into two halves until individual elements are left, and then it merges these sorted halves back together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down its space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recursive Call Stack Space:\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide Phase: When Merge Sort is called on an array of size N, it recursively calls itself on the left half (N/2) and then on the right half (N/2). However, these recursive calls are not simultaneous. The entire left sub-problem is processed (divided and then merged) before the right sub-problem even begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth of Recursion: Similar to Binary Search, the recursion depth for Merge Sort is logarithmic. An array of size N is repeatedly halved (N→N/2→N/4→⋯→1). The maximum number of active (pending) function calls on the call stack at any point is log \n",
    "2\n",
    "​\n",
    " N. Each function call adds a constant amount of memory (k) to the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contribution: Therefore, the space complexity due to the recursive call stack is O(logN). This is the memory needed to store the various function frames as the algorithm traverses down one branch of the recursion tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Auxiliary Space for Merging:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Merge Function: The most significant contributor to Merge Sort's space complexity comes from its merge function. When two sorted sub-arrays are merged, a new auxiliary array is typically created to store the combined sorted elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Size of Auxiliary Array: This auxiliary array has a size equal to the total size of the two sub-arrays being merged. For instance, when two sub-arrays of size N/2 each are merged, a new array of size N is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary Nature: While many auxiliary arrays are created during the merging process (e.g., N/2-sized arrays, then N/4-sized arrays, and so on), these arrays are temporary. Once a merge operation is complete, the auxiliary array used for that specific merge is no longer needed, and its memory can be freed or reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the Peak Space:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to determining the overall space complexity lies in identifying the peak memory usage at any single moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion vs. Merging:\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive calls build up to a depth of O(logN).\n",
    "\n",
    "The merge operation, particularly for the largest sub-arrays, requires O(N) auxiliary space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence of Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm first performs recursive calls, building up the call stack to a depth of logN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the base cases (single elements) are reached, the merging process begins. When the smallest sub-arrays are merged, smaller auxiliary arrays are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the recursion unwinds and larger sub-arrays are merged, progressively larger auxiliary arrays are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest auxiliary array created will be of size N, occurring when the final two halves (each of size N/2) are merged to form the fully sorted array of size N.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Simultaneous Large Auxiliaries: Importantly, the N/2-sized auxiliary arrays created during the merge of sub-arrays do not coexist simultaneously with the N-sized auxiliary array created at the very end. When N/2-sized sub-arrays are merged, their temporary auxiliary array is created and then freed. Only after all smaller merges are complete will the final N-sized merge occur, requiring its own N-sized auxiliary array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dominant Term: At any given point, the memory consumed by the recursive call stack (O(logN)) and the memory consumed by the largest currently active auxiliary array for merging are summed. The largest auxiliary array ever needed is of size N. For sufficiently large N, N is significantly greater than logN (e.g., if N=1,000,000, log \n",
    "2\n",
    "​\n",
    " N≈20).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the total auxiliary space complexity for Merge Sort is dominated by the O(N) space required for the temporary array during the largest merge operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering both components:\n",
    "Space Complexity = (Space for Recursive Calls) + (Auxiliary Space for Merging)\n",
    "Space Complexity = O(logN)+O(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since N grows much faster than logN, the dominant term is O(N).\n",
    "Thus, the space complexity of Merge Sort is O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Caveat (In-place Merge Sort variations):\n",
    "While the standard Merge Sort implementation uses O(N) auxiliary space, there exist more complex \"in-place\" variations that attempt to reduce this to O(1) or O(logN). However, these typically come with a significant trade-off in terms of time complexity (increasing it beyond O(NlogN)) or involve much more complex implementations. The typical Merge Sort algorithm, as taught and widely implemented, has O(N) space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed analysis helps solidify the understanding that space complexity is determined by the peak memory footprint, carefully considering both the recursive call stack and dynamically allocated data structures, and identifying the dominant term."
