    "Space Complexity of Iterative Algorithms (Recap)\n",
    "Iterative algorithms, characterized by loops, generally exhibit O(1) (constant) auxiliary space complexity. This is because they typically use a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion Sort: This algorithm sorts an array in-place. It utilizes a few variables (e.g., key to store the current element and j for loop iteration) whose memory footprint does not depend on the input array's size. No new arrays or data structures are created that scale with the input. Hence, its auxiliary space complexity is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Maximum Element in an Array: An algorithm to find the maximum element in an array also operates with a constant number of variables (e.g., max_val to store the current maximum). Its memory usage remains constant irrespective of the array's size, leading to an O(1) auxiliary space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general rule for iterative algorithms is that if they don't dynamically allocate data structures whose size is proportional to the input, their auxiliary space complexity is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity of Recursive Algorithms: Fibonacci Number Example\n",
    "Recursive algorithms, unlike iterative ones, inherently use the call stack to manage function calls. Each time a recursive function is invoked, a new stack frame is pushed onto the call stack. This stack frame stores local variables, parameters, and the return address for that specific function call. The collection of these stack frames contributes to the auxiliary space complexity."

    "Understanding the Call Sequence for Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "While the recursive Fibonacci function might not explicitly create arrays or lists, its recursive calls build up a stack of pending operations. It's crucial to understand the order in which these calls are executed and when stack frames are added or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider fib(4):\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(4) is called. A stack frame for fib(4) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside fib(4), fib(3) is called (left child in the recursion tree). A stack frame for fib(3) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside fib(3), fib(2) is called. A stack frame for fib(2) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside fib(2), fib(1) is called. A stack frame for fib(1) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(1) hits the base case and returns. Its stack frame is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control returns to fib(2), which then calls fib(0) (right child of fib(2)). A stack frame for fib(0) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(0) hits the base case and returns. Its stack frame is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(2) now has both results and returns. Its stack frame is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control returns to fib(3), which has completed its left branch. fib(3) then calls fib(1) (right child of fib(3)). A stack frame for fib(1) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(1) hits the base case and returns. Its stack frame is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(3) now has both results and returns. Its stack frame is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control returns to fib(4), which has completed its left branch. fib(4) then calls fib(2) (right child of fib(4)). A stack frame for fib(2) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues similarly for fib(2)'s subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak Memory Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical point for space complexity is the peak number of active stack frames at any given moment. In the Fibonacci recursion, the calls form a tree. The deepest path in this recursion tree determines the maximum number of stack frames simultaneously present on the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "For fib(N), the longest chain of recursive calls follows the path: fib(N) -> fib(N-1) -> fib(N-2) -> ... -> fib(1) (or fib(0)). This path has a depth of N. At the deepest point of this path, there will be N active stack frames. Each stack frame consumes a constant amount of memory (k). Therefore, the total auxiliary space at peak usage is proportional to N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the auxiliary space complexity for the recursive Fibonacci algorithm is O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Distinction - Time vs. Space in Recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's crucial to differentiate between the large number of total recursive calls (which is exponential, O(2 \n",
    "N\n",
    " ), for naive Fibonacci) and the maximum concurrent stack frames. While many calls are made, stack frames are only active until their respective functions return. Once a function returns, its stack frame is popped, and its memory is freed, allowing that memory to be reused by subsequent calls. This is analogous to deleting a file from a pen drive â€“ the space is freed and becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, even though fib(N) makes O(2 \n",
    "N\n",
    " ) total calls, the space complexity is not O(2 \n",
    "N\n",
    " ). It's O(N) because at any given time, the maximum depth of the recursion stack is N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Understanding space complexity is vital for designing efficient algorithms, especially when working with recursive solutions or in memory-constrained environments. While iterative algorithms often achieve constant auxiliary space (O(1)), recursive algorithms, due to their use of the call stack, can incur auxiliary space proportional to the depth of their recursion (O(N) for linear recursion like factorial or Fibonacci, O(\n",
    "logN) for divide-and-conquer like binary search). This difference often explains why a recursive solution might encounter memory limits where an iterative one with the same time complexity succeeds."
