    "The traceback indicates a `ValueError` in the `take_input_better()` function, which is trying to convert an empty string `''` to an integer using `int()`. The error occurs because the user pressed Enter without typing a number, resulting in an empty input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Code Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provided is for a singly linked list and contains several functions for creating and manipulating it. Here's a breakdown of the key components and how they're intended to work:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from common import Node,take_input_better,print_LL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line imports three elements from a file named `common.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Node`: A class to represent a single node in the linked list, likely containing `data` and a `next` pointer.\n",
    "  - `take_input_better`: A function to take user input and build a linked list. This is where the error originates.\n",
    "  - `print_LL`: A function to print the elements of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- end list -->\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "head = take_input_better()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line calls the `take_input_better()` function to get user input for the linked list. This function is designed to prompt the user to enter numbers for the nodes and build a linked list from them. The error traceback shows that the `ValueError` occurs on line 50 of `common.py` within this function, specifically at the line `value = int(input(\"Enter the value of Node :- \"))`. The `input()` function returns an empty string `''` when the user just presses Enter, and `int('')` raises the `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print_LL(head)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line attempts to print the linked list, but it's never reached because the program crashes at the previous line due to the `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Linked List Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the code defines various functions to perform operations on the linked list, though none of them are executed in the provided traceback:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`insert_at_head(head, data)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This function inserts a new node at the beginning of the linked list.\n",
    "  - `newNode = Node(data)`: Creates a new node with the specified data.\n",
    "  - `newNode.next = head`: Makes the new node's `next` pointer point to the current head of the list.\n",
    "  - `head = newNode`: Updates the `head` to be the new node.\n",
    "  - This is an **O(1)** operation because it doesn't need to traverse the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`insert_at_tail(head, data)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This function adds a new node to the end of the list.\n",
    "  - `if(head is None):`: Handles the case where the list is empty.\n",
    "  - `temp = head`: Initializes a temporary pointer `temp` to the head.\n",
    "  - `while(temp.next != None):`: Traverses the list until `temp` points to the last node (the one whose `next` is `None`).\n",
    "  - `temp.next = newNode`: Appends the new node to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`insert_at_tail_recursively(head, data)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This function does the same as `insert_at_tail` but using a recursive approach.\n",
    "  - `if(head is None):`: The base case, which creates and returns the new node when it reaches the end of the list.\n",
    "  - `head.next = insert_at_tail_recursively(head.next, data)`: The recursive step, which calls the function on the rest of the list and links the result back to the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`insert_at_index(head, data, index)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This function inserts a new node at a specific `index`.\n",
    "  - `if(index == 0):`: Handles the special case of inserting at the head.\n",
    "  - It uses a `while` loop to traverse the list to the node just before the target index.\n",
    "  - `if(temp is None):`: Checks for an out-of-bounds index.\n",
    "  - `newNode.next = temp.next`: Links the new node to the node currently at the target index.\n",
    "  - `temp.next = newNode`: Links the previous node to the new node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`insert_at_index_recursively(head, data, index)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A recursive version of `insert_at_index`.\n",
    "  - `if(index == 0):`: The base case for insertion at the head.\n",
    "  - `if(head == None):`: The base case for an out-of-bounds index.\n",
    "  - `head.next = insert_at_index_recursively(head.next, data, index-1)`: The recursive step, which decrements the index and moves to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- end list -->\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "head = insert_at_index_recursively(head,35,3)\n",
    "print(\"After Inserting at Index\")\n",
    "print_LL(head)\n",
    "```\n",
