    "### üß± Node Class\n",
    "A **`Node`** is the fundamental building block of a linked list. Think of it as a container. The `__init__` constructor initializes a new node with two parts:\n",
    "1.  **`self.data`**: This holds the actual data or value of the node. In your example, this would be an integer like `10` or `20`.\n",
    "2.  **`self.next`**: This is a **pointer** or **reference** to the next node in the sequence. It's initially set to `None`, indicating there's no node following it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Linked List Class\n",
    "The **`LinkedList`** class manages the entire list. It primarily uses a **`head`** attribute, which is a pointer to the very first node of the list. If the list is empty, `head` is `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`insert_at_index(self, index, data)`**\n",
    "This method adds a new node with the specified `data` at the given `index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1: Create the new node**\n",
    "    * `new_node = Node(data)`: A new `Node` object is created to store the data you want to insert.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 2: Handle special case (insert at head)** üß†\n",
    "    * `if index == 0:`: This checks if the user wants to insert at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "    * `new_node.next = self.head`: The new node's `next` pointer is made to point to the current head of the list.\n",
    "    * `self.head = new_node`: The head of the linked list is updated to the newly created node, making it the new first node.\n",
    "    * `return`: The function then exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 3: Traverse to the insertion point** üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n",
    "    * `current = self.head`: A temporary pointer, `current`, is initialized to the head of the list.\n",
    "    * `count = 0`: A counter is initialized to keep track of the current position.\n",
    "    * `while current is not None and count < index - 1:`: This loop iterates through the list. It stops at the node **just before** the desired insertion index. For example, to insert at index 3, the loop stops at index 2. This is because you need to update the `next` pointer of the node *before* the insertion point.\n",
    "    * `current = current.next`: The `current` pointer moves to the next node in the list.\n",
    "    * `count += 1`: The counter is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 4: Handle out-of-bounds index**\n",
    "    * `if current is None:`: If the loop finishes and `current` is `None`, it means the original list was shorter than the provided index, so the index is invalid. An error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 5: Insert the new node** üîÑ\n",
    "    * `new_node.next = current.next`: The new node's `next` pointer is set to point to the node that `current` was originally pointing to.\n",
    "    * `current.next = new_node`: The `next` pointer of the node at `current` (the node before the insertion point) is updated to point to the new node, effectively linking it into the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`print_list(self)`**\n",
    "This method iterates through the linked list from the head and prints the data of each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `current = self.head`: A temporary pointer `current` starts at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "* `while current:`: The loop continues as long as `current` is not `None`.\n",
    "* `print(current.data, end=\" -> \")`: The data of the current node is printed, followed by \" -> \" to show the connection.\n",
    "* `current = current.next`: `current` moves to the next node.\n",
    "* `print(\"None\")`: After the loop finishes (when `current` is `None`), \"None\" is printed to signify the end of the list.\n",
