    "## ⚙️ Function Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Node` Class\n",
    "The `Node` class is the fundamental building block of the linked list. Each `Node` object contains two attributes: `data`, which stores the value, and `next`, a pointer to the next node in the sequence. If `next` is `None`, it signifies the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `delete_at_index(head, index)`\n",
    "This function is responsible for removing a node from the linked list at a given zero-based `index`. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Empty List Check:** The function first checks if the `head` is `None`. If the list is empty, it prints an error message and returns the `head` as is.\n",
    "2.  **Delete at Head:** If the `index` is `0`, the function simply returns `head.next`, effectively making the second node the new head and discarding the original first node.\n",
    "3.  **Traverse to the Predecessor:** For any other index, the function initializes a `temp` pointer to the `head` and a `count` to `0`. It then iterates through the list until `temp` points to the node **just before** the one to be deleted (i.e., at `index - 1`).\n",
    "4.  **Out-of-Bounds Check:** After the loop, it checks if `temp` or `temp.next` is `None`. This condition is true if the requested `index` is greater than or equal to the length of the list, indicating an out-of-bounds error. It prints a message and returns without making any changes.\n",
    "5.  **Node Deletion:** If the index is valid, it reassigns `temp.next` to `temp.next.next`. This operation effectively \"skips over\" the node at the specified index, removing it from the chain. The garbage collector will eventually reclaim the memory of the skipped node.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace the execution for the deletion of `index 2` from the list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial State:** `head` points to the node with data `1`. The list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None`.\n",
    "2.  **Function Call:** `delete_at_index(head, 2)` is called. The `index` is not `0`, so the function proceeds to traverse.\n",
    "3.  **Traversal:**\n",
    "    * `temp` starts at the node with data `1`. `count` is `0`.\n",
    "    * The `while` loop runs. `temp` moves to the node with data `2` (the node at `index 1`), and `count` becomes `1`.\n",
    "    * The loop continues. `temp` moves to the node with data `3` (the node at `index 2`), and `count` becomes `2`.\n",
    "    * The condition `count < index - 1` (`2 < 1`) is false, so the loop terminates. **Wait, let's re-examine this part of the code carefully.** The loop is `while temp is not None and count < index - 1:`. In our case, `index` is `2`, so we need to stop when `count` is `0`. The code is buggy! Let's re-evaluate the intended behavior.\n",
    "    * Okay, let's correct the conceptual walkthrough based on the provided code. The loop is intended to stop at the node *before* the one to be deleted. So for `index=2`, it should stop at `index=1`.\n",
    "        * `temp` starts at `head` (data `1`). `count` is `0`.\n",
    "        * Loop condition `temp is not None` and `count < 2 - 1` (`0 < 1`) is true.\n",
    "        * `temp` moves to the next node (data `2`). `count` becomes `1`.\n",
    "        * Loop condition `temp is not None` and `count < 1` is false. The loop terminates. `temp` is now at the node with data `2`.\n",
    "4.  **Deletion:**\n",
    "    * `temp.next` (the pointer from the node with data `2`) currently points to the node with data `3`.\n",
    "    * `temp.next.next` (the pointer from the node with data `3`) points to the node with data `4`.\n",
    "    * The line `temp.next = temp.next.next` is executed. The `next` pointer of the node with data `2` is updated to point to the node with data `4`.\n",
    "5.  **Result:** The list becomes `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> None`. The node with data `3` is no longer part of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's also trace the out-of-bounds example (`index=10`)\n",
    "1.  **Initial State:** The list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None`.\n",
    "2.  **Function Call:** `delete_at_index(head, 10)` is called.\n",
    "3.  **Traversal:** The `while` loop will iterate until `temp` reaches the end of the list.\n",
    "    * `count` will increment up to `4`, and `temp` will point to the last node (data `5`). The loop condition `count < 10 - 1` (`4 < 9`) is still true.\n",
    "    * `temp` will attempt to move to `temp.next` which is `None`. The loop will terminate because `temp` is now `None`.\n",
    "4.  **Out-of-Bounds Check:** The condition `if temp is None or temp.next is None:` evaluates to true.\n",
    "5.  **Result:** The function prints \"Out of Bounds\" and returns the original `head`, leaving the list unchanged."

    "Let's use a linked list `A -> B -> C -> D -> None` and assume we want to delete node `C`. The `temp` variable in the program would have already traversed to node `B`, which is the node right before `C`.\n",
    "\n",

    "    * `temp.next` points to the node `C`.\n",
    "    * This line creates a new variable, `nodeToBeDeleted`, and assigns it the reference to node `C`. This is done for clarity, holding a temporary reference to the node we're about to remove.\n",
    "    * The list remains unchanged: `A -> B -> C -> D -> None`.\n",
    "2.  **`nodeAfterDeletedNode = nodeToBeDeleted.next`**\n",
    "    * `nodeToBeDeleted` holds the reference to node `C`. `nodeToBeDeleted.next` points to node `D`.\n",
    "    * This line creates another temporary variable, `nodeAfterDeletedNode`, and assigns it the reference to node `D`. This variable holds a reference to the node that will come **after** the one we are deleting.\n",
    "    * The list is still unchanged: `A -> B -> C -> D -> None`.\n",
    "3.  **`temp.next = nodeAfterDeletedNode`**\n",
    "    * `temp` is still at node `B`. `temp.next` is the pointer from `B` to `C`.\n",
    "    * `nodeAfterDeletedNode` holds the reference to node `D`.\n",
    "    * This line is the key to the deletion. It reassigns the pointer from `B` to `D`.\n",
    "    * After this line, the linked list looks like this: `A -> B -> D -> None`. The node `C` is no longer part of the list's chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "By changing `temp.next` to point directly to `nodeAfterDeletedNode`, the code effectively **skips** over `nodeToBeDeleted`. The `nodeToBeDeleted` (node `C`) is now orphaned and, in most languages with automatic memory management like Python, will eventually be cleaned up by the garbage collector. "
