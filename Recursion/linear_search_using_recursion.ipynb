    "###Linear Search Theory with Recursion\n",
    "Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "When approaching linear search with recursion, we again apply the fundamental recursive principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Similarity: The problem of searching for an element in an array can be broken down into: \"Is the first element what I'm looking for? If not, search the rest of the array.\" The \"rest of the array\" is just a smaller instance of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Element Found: If the current element being examined matches the target, then we've found it. The recursion stops, and we return the index.\n",
    "Array Exhausted: If we've looked at all elements (i.e., the current sub-array is empty) and haven't found the target, then the element is not in the array. The recursion stops, and we return an indicator like -1 (meaning \"not found\").\n",
    "Recursive Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the base cases are not met (i.e., the array is not empty and the current element doesn't match the target), then the current element is not the one we want.\n",
    "The problem is then delegated to a recursive call on the rest of the array. The current function simply passes on the result of this recursive call.\n",
    "Key Idea for Recursion: Each recursive call focuses on a smaller portion of the array. We peel off one element at a time (either from the beginning or end) until we hit a base case."
