    "Binary Search Theory with Recursion\n",
    "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept of Recursive Binary Search:\n",
    "Divide and Conquer: The core idea is that if you're looking for an element X in a sorted array A:\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the middle element mid_val = A[mid].\n",
    "If mid_val is X, you found it!\n",
    "If X is smaller than mid_val, then X (if it exists) must be in the left half of the array. You recursively search the left half.\n",
    "If X is larger than mid_val, then X (if it exists) must be in the right half of the array. You recursively search the right half.\n",
    "Self-Similarity: The problem of searching a target in a sorted array (or a portion of it) is the same problem as searching in a smaller sorted sub-array. This self-similarity makes recursion ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Element Found: If the middle element A[mid] is equal to the target, return mid (the index where it's found).\n",
    "Search Space Exhausted (Element Not Found): If the start index ever becomes greater than the end index, it means the search interval has become empty. The target cannot be in the array, so return -1.\n",
    "The Need for a Helper Function\n",
    "In recursive binary search, we often use a helper function because the recursive process needs to keep track of the current search interval. This interval is defined by a start index and an end index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The public-facing function (binary_search) should ideally just take the array and the target_element. It's not the user's concern to know about start and end indices when they first call the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why a Helper is Needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean Public Interface: binary_search(arr, target) is user-friendly.\n",
    "Internal State Management: The recursive calls need additional parameters (start, end) to define the ever-shrinking search space. The helper function (_binary_search_recursive_helper) manages this internal state.\n",
    "Initial Call Setup: The wrapper binary_search sets up the initial start (0) and end (len(arr) - 1) for the entire array before passing them to the helper.\n",
    "How We Update Start and End Points (The Search Space)\n",
    "This is the core of binary search's efficiency. With each recursive call, the search interval is cut in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Midpoint: In each step, you find the middle index:\n",
    "mid = (start + end) // 2 (using integer division).\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare and Adjust:\n",
    "\n",
    "If arr[mid] == target: Found it! Return mid.\n",
    "If target < arr[mid]: The target must be in the left half. The new search range becomes start to mid - 1.\n",
    "Recursive call: _helper(arr, target, start, mid - 1)\n",
    "If target > arr[mid]: The target must be in the right half. The new search range becomes mid + 1 to end.\n",
    "Recursive call: _helper(arr, target, mid + 1, end)\n",
    "This process ensures that the start and end pointers converge."
