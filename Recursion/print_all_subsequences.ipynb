    "Imagine you're the main chef in a kitchen, and you have a long list of ingredients (your string s1). Your job is to create all possible combinations of dishes using these ingredients, putting them on a single plate (taken_so_far).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't do it all yourself, so you have a very special assistant (your recursive function calls) who knows exactly how to do the same job but for smaller lists of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Setup: What Each Variable Represents\n",
    "\n",
    "s1: This is the remaining list of ingredients (the part of the string you haven't decided on yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "taken_so_far: This is your current plate. It holds all the ingredients (characters) you've decided to include in this particular dish so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Core Idea: Two Branches of Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "When you look at the first ingredient (current_char) in s1, you have only two fundamental options for this ingredient:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Yes, I'll put this on my plate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No, I won't put this on my plate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These two choices are mutually exclusive for that single ingredient, but they represent the two paths your cooking process can take from this point forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diving into the Two Recursive Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say s1 = \"ABC\" and taken_so_far = \"\" (your plate is empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "You look at the first ingredient: current_char = 'A'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining ingredients for your assistant are: small_input = \"BC\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Call 1: print_subsequences(small_input, taken_so_far + current_char)\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition: This call represents the decision \"YES, I am taking 'A' for this dish.\"\n",
    "What's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "small_input (\"BC\"): You're telling your assistant, \"Okay, 'A' is handled. Now, you figure out all the ways to combine dishes from 'B' and 'C'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "taken_so_far + current_char (\"\" + \"A\" which becomes \"A\"): You're also telling your assistant, \"And by the way, make sure that 'A' is already on the plate before you start adding 'B' or 'C'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chain Reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assistant gets \"BC\" and \"A\". They look at 'B'.\n",
    "\n",
    "They'll make a call to take 'B' (\"C\", \"AB\").\n",
    "\n",
    "They'll make a call to not take 'B' (\"C\", \"A\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This continues until the s1 (remaining ingredients) becomes empty. When it does, whatever is on the plate (taken_so_far) gets printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this \"take 'A'\" branch will eventually lead to subsequences like \"ABC\", \"AB\", \"AC\", \"A\" (all starting with 'A').\n",
    "\n",
    "Call 2: print_subsequences(small_input, taken_so_far)\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition: This call represents the decision \"NO, I am not taking 'A' for this dish.\"\n",
    "What's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "small_input (\"BC\"): You're telling your assistant, \"Okay, 'A' is skipped. Now, you figure out all the ways to combine dishes from 'B' and 'C'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "taken_so_far (\"\"): You're also telling your assistant, \"And by the way, make sure that the plate is still empty (or whatever it was before considering 'A') when you start adding 'B' or 'C'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chain Reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assistant gets \"BC\" and \"\". They look at 'B'.\n",
    "\n",
    "They'll make a call to take 'B' (\"C\", \"B\").\n",
    "\n",
    "They'll make a call to not take 'B' (\"C\", \"\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This continues until s1 (remaining ingredients) becomes empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this \"don't take 'A'\" branch will eventually lead to subsequences like \"BC\", \"B\", \"C\", \"\" (all not starting with 'A').\n",
    "Why are both calls necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because every single subsequence must either contain the first character, or not contain the first character. By exploring both possibilities for the first character, and then recursively doing the same for the rest of the string, you cover every single combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as creating a decision tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Start (\"ABC\", \"\")\n",
    "               /         \\\n",

    "       /                       \\\n",
    "   (\"BC\", \"A\")              (\"BC\", \"\")\n",
    "     /     \\                  /     \\\n",
    "(Take 'B') (Don't Take 'B') (Take 'B') (Don't Take 'B')\n",
    "   /           \\              /           \\\n",
    "(\"C\", \"AB\")   (\"C\", \"A\")   (\"C\", \"B\")    (\"C\", \"\")\n",
    "   / \\         / \\          / \\           / \\\n",
    "(Take 'C') (No 'C') (Take 'C') (No 'C') (Take 'C') (No 'C') (Take 'C') (No 'C')\n",
    "  /   \\       /   \\        /   \\        /   \\\n",
    "(\"\", \"ABC\") (\"\", \"AB\") (\"\", \"AC\") (\"\", \"A\") (\"\", \"BC\") (\"\", \"B\") (\"\", \"C\") (\"\", \"\")\n",
    "(Print!)     (Print!)     (Print!)     (Print!)     (Print!)     (Print!)     (Print!)     (Print!)\n",
    "Every path from the top of the tree to a leaf node (where s1 becomes empty) represents one unique subsequence. The two recursive calls are simply the two branches you take at each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this \"chef and assistant\" analogy help clarify how these two fundamental calls work together to explore all possibilities?"
