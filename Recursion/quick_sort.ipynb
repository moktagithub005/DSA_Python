    "Quick Sort Theory (Recursion and Divide & Conquer)\n",
    "Quick Sort, invented by C.A.R. Hoare, is an efficient, comparison-based, in-place sorting algorithm. Like Merge Sort, it follows the Divide and Conquer strategy, but its key difference lies in where the bulk of the work is done: Merge Sort does most of its work in the \"combine\" (merge) step, while Quick Sort does most of its work in the \"divide\" (partition) step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Divide and Conquer\" Paradigm in Quick Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Sort involves three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide (Partition):\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a pivot element from the array (various strategies exist: first, last, middle, random).\n",
    "Partitioning: Rearrange the array (in-place) such that:\n",
    "All elements less than the pivot come before it.\n",
    "All elements greater than the pivot come after it.\n",
    "Elements equal to the pivot can go on either side (or in a separate \"equal\" section).\n",
    "After partitioning, the pivot element is in its final sorted position.\n",
    "Conquer (Recursively Sort):\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursively apply Quick Sort to the sub-array of elements less than the pivot.\n",
    "Recursively apply Quick Sort to the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is trivial for Quick Sort! Because the pivot is already in its final sorted position, and the left and right sub-arrays will be sorted independently by the recursive calls, no explicit \"combine\" step (like merging) is needed. The array is sorted in place.\n",
    "Theoretical Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an unsorted array: [7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Call: quick_sort(arr, 0, 7) (where 0 is low and 7 is high)\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide (Partition) Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose Pivot: Let's pick the last element as the pivot (a common choice): 4.\n",
    "Partitioning Logic: We rearrange the array such that elements smaller than 4 are to its left, and larger elements are to its right.\n",
    "[7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "After partitioning, the array might look something like: [2, 1, 3, **4**, 8, 5, 6, 7]\n",
    "The pivot 4 is now at its final sorted position (index 3). Let's call this pivot_index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conquer Phase (Recursive Calls):\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursively sort the left sub-array (elements less than pivot):\n",
    "quick_sort(arr, 0, pivot_index - 1) → quick_sort(arr, 0, 2) (for [2, 1, 3])\n",
    "Recursively sort the right sub-array (elements greater than pivot):\n",
    "quick_sort(arr, pivot_index + 1, 7) → quick_sort(arr, 4, 7) (for [8, 5, 6, 7])\n",
    "This process continues until the base case is reached:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a sub-array contains 0 or 1 element (low >= high), it's considered sorted, and the recursion stops.\n",
    "No Combine Phase: Once all recursive calls return, the entire array is sorted because each pivot was placed correctly, and its sub-arrays were independently sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Partitioning Operation (Crucial Part):\n",
    "The efficiency of Quick Sort heavily depends on an effective partitioning scheme. A common scheme is Lomuto Partition Scheme or Hoare Partition Scheme. Here, we'll conceptually use Lomuto:\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Place elements smaller than pivot to its left, and larger elements to its right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the last element as the pivot (e.g., arr[high]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain an index i (initially low - 1) for the \"smaller elements\" boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate j from low to high - 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "If arr[j] is less than or equal to pivot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increment i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swap arr[i] and arr[j]. (This moves smaller elements to the left section).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, swap arr[i + 1] (which is where the pivot should end up) and arr[high] (the pivot itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return i + 1 (the pivot's final index).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Partitioning [7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4] with pivot = 4 (last element):\n",
    "\n",
    "i = -1 (conceptual low - 1), pivot = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "j = 0, arr[0] = 7 (not <= 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "j = 1, arr[1] = 2 (<= 4). i becomes 0. Swap arr[0] (7) and arr[1] (2). Array: [2, 7, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "j = 2, arr[2] = 1 (<= 4). i becomes 1. Swap arr[1] (7) and arr[2] (1). Array: [2, 1, 7, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "j = 3, arr[3] = 6 (not <= 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "j = 4, arr[4] = 8 (not <= 4)\n",

    "Loop ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swap arr[i + 1] (arr[3], which is 6) and arr[high] (arr[7], which is 4).\n",
    "Final array after partition: [2, 1, 3, **4**, 8, 5, 7, 6] (pivot 4 is at index 3). Return pivot_index = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time and Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Best/Average Case: O(NlogN)\n",
    "This occurs when the pivot selection consistently divides the array into roughly equal halves. The logN factor comes from the depth of recursion (like dividing a binary tree), and the N factor comes from the partitioning step (each element is visited/compared at each level).\n",
    "Worst Case: O(N \n",
    "2\n",
    " )\n",
    "This happens when the pivot selection consistently leads to highly unbalanced partitions (e.g., picking the smallest or largest element as the pivot every time in an already sorted or reverse-sorted array). In this scenario, one sub-array will be empty or single-element, and the other will contain N−1 elements, leading to N levels of recursion, with N comparisons at each level.\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst Case: O(N) (due to recursion stack depth in the worst-case O(N \n",
    "2\n",
    " ) time scenario).\n",
    "Average Case: O(logN) (due to recursion stack depth in the O(NlogN) time scenario).\n",
    "It's considered an \"in-place\" sort because it typically only requires a small constant amount of auxiliary space beyond the recursion stack for element swapping.\n",
    "Advantages of Quick Sort:\n",
    "Generally Fastest: In practice, Quick Sort is often faster than other O(NlogN) algorithms like Merge Sort for average cases due to better constant factors (fewer data movements, better cache performance).\n",
    "In-Place Sorting: It sorts the array by rearranging elements within the original array, minimizing additional memory usage (apart from recursion stack).\n",
    "Good for Large Data: Its efficiency and in-place nature make it suitable for large datasets that fit in memory.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Quick Sort:\n",
    "Worst-Case Performance: The O(N \n",
    "2\n",
    " ) worst-case time complexity is a significant drawback if not handled (e.g., by using a good pivot selection strategy like median-of-three or random pivot).\n",
    "Not Stable: Quick Sort is generally not a stable sort, meaning the relative order of equal elements may not be preserved.\n",
    "Recursive Overhead: Like all recursive algorithms, it has function call overhead and stack space requirements, which can lead to stack overflow for very deep recursions (though less of an issue in average cases)."

    "Detailed Explanation of the Code\n",
    "The Quick Sort implementation consists of two main functions: _partition (the \"Divide\" step) and quick_sort_recursive (the \"Conquer\" step), wrapped by a user-friendly quick_sort function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _partition(arr, low, high) - The \"Divide\" Step\n",
    "This function is the heart of Quick Sort. It rearranges the sub-array arr[low...high] so that a chosen pivot element is placed in its correct sorted position, with all smaller elements to its left and all larger elements to its right.\n",
    "\n",
    "pivot = arr[high]: We choose the last element of the current sub-array (arr[high]) as the pivot. This is a simple choice for the Lomuto partition scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "i = low - 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "i is an index that acts as a boundary. Its role is to keep track of the \"smaller elements\" section.\n",
    "Initially, this section is empty, so i is set to one position before the low boundary. When we find an element smaller than the pivot, i will be incremented, and that element will be swapped into arr[i].\n",
    "for j in range(low, high)::\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop iterates j from the low index up to high - 1 (i.e., it scans through all elements in the current sub-array except the pivot itself, which is at arr[high]).\n",
    "\n",
    "if arr[j] <= pivot::\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the loop, for each element arr[j]:\n",
    "\n",
    "If arr[j] is less than or equal to the pivot, it means this element belongs in the \"smaller elements\" section to the left of where the pivot will eventually be.\n",
    "\n",
    "i += 1: We increment i. This moves the boundary of the \"smaller elements\" section one step to the right, making space for arr[j].\n",
    "\n",
    "arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]: We then swap arr[i] and arr[j].\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, arr[i] might be an element that was previously considered \"larger\" (and skipped over) or arr[i] could even be arr[j] itself if i and j are the same (no actual swap).\n",
    "\n",
    "This swap ensures that elements smaller than (or equal to) the pivot are moved to the left side of i.\n",
    "\n",
    "arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loop finishes, i points to the last element that was found to be smaller than or equal to the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, arr[i + 1] is the first element in the \"greater than pivot\" section (or just the position where the pivot should go if all elements were smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "We swap arr[i + 1] with arr[high] (which holds the pivot). This places the pivot in its final sorted position.\n",
    "\n",
    "return i + 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns i + 1, which is the pivot_index (the final sorted position of the pivot). This index is crucial because it serves as the dividing point for the two subsequent recursive calls.\n",
