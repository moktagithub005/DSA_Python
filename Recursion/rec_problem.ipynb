    "\n",
    "if n == 0:: This is the crucial base case. For factorial calculations, 0! (zero factorial) is defined as 1. The base case provides a stopping point for the recursion, preventing an infinite loop. When n becomes 0, the function simply returns 1 without making further recursive calls.\n",

    "This process of breaking down the problem into smaller, identical subproblems until the base case is reached, and then building up the solution, is characteristic of recursion.\n",

    "Testing the Function: The test_factorial Function\n",
    "Before allowing user interaction, the code includes a test_factorial() function to verify the correctness of the factorial function.\n",

    "Negative Input: if n < 0:: Explicitly checks if the input is negative and prints an error, as factorial is typically defined for non-negative integers.\n",
    "Large Input Warning: if n > 20:: Warns the user about potential stack overflow issues for numbers larger than 20, but still proceeds with the calculation. This is a pragmatic choice, allowing the user to try larger numbers while being informed of the risk.\n",
    "RecursionError: except RecursionError:: This specifically catches errors that occur when the recursion depth limit is exceeded (i.e., when n is too large for the system to handle the nested function calls). A user-friendly message is displayed in this case.\n",

    "Summary of Workflow\n",
    "The script starts by defining the recursive factorial function.\n",
    "It then defines a test_factorial function with several predefined inputs and expected outputs to verify the correctness of the factorial function.\n",
    "An interactive main function is defined to handle user input, validate it, call the factorial function, and display the result, including error handling for invalid inputs or potential recursion depth issues.\n",
    "When the script is executed directly, the if __name__ == \"__main__\": block ensures that:\n",
    "The test_factorial() function runs first, providing an immediate check of the factorial function's accuracy.\n",
    "After the tests are complete, the main() function is called, allowing the user to interactively calculate factorials.\n",

If you try to calculate sum_of_number(n) for a very large n (e.g., n = 5000), you will likely encounter a RecursionError because the function calls will stack up too deeply.\n",
    "For calculating sums, the iterative method (using a loop) or the mathematical formula (n * (n + 1) / 2) are generally more efficient and safer for large values of n. However, your code is an excellent demonstration of how recursion works!"

    "How the count_digits_recursive(n) Function Works\n",
    "This function uses the principle of recursion to count the digits. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Negative Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "if n < 0: n = -n\n",
    "The very first step checks if the input number n is negative. If it is, it converts n to its positive equivalent (e.g., -123 becomes 123). This is because the number of digits in -123 is the same as in 123, and working with positive numbers simplifies the subsequent logic.\n",
    "Base Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "if n >= 0 and n < 10: return 1\n",
    "This is the stopping condition for the recursion. If the number n is between 0 and 9 (inclusive), it means it's a single-digit number. In this case, the function immediately returns 1, because a single-digit number has exactly one digit.\n",
    "This also correctly handles the input n = 0, returning 1 digit.\n",
    "Recursive Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "else: return 1 + count_digits_recursive(n // 10)\n",
    "This is executed when n is a multi-digit number (e.g., 123, 45, 1000).\n",
    "n // 10 (Integer Division): This operation effectively removes the last digit of the number. For example:\n",
    "123 // 10 results in 12\n",
    "45 // 10 results in 4\n",
    "1000 // 10 results in 100\n",
    "1 + count_digits_recursive(n // 10): The logic here is: \"The total number of digits in n is equal to 1 (for the digit we just effectively 'removed' or considered) plus the number of digits in the remaining part of the number (n // 10).\"\n",
    "The function then calls itself (count_digits_recursive) with this smaller number (n // 10). This process continues, removing one digit at a time, until the number eventually becomes a single-digit number, at which point the base case is triggered.\n",
    "Step-by-Step Example: Tracing count_digits_recursive(123)\n",
    "Let's trace how the function calculates the number of digits for 123:\n",
    "\n",
    "count_digits_recursive(123) is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "n is 123 (not negative).\n",
    "Is 123 >= 0 and 123 < 10? No.\n",
    "Go to the else block.\n",
    "It wants to calculate 1 + count_digits_recursive(123 // 10), which is 1 + count_digits_recursive(12).\n",
    "Now, count_digits_recursive(12) is called.\n",
    "count_digits_recursive(12) is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "n is 12.\n",
    "Is 12 >= 0 and 12 < 10? No.\n",
    "Go to the else block.\n",
    "It wants to calculate 1 + count_digits_recursive(12 // 10), which is 1 + count_digits_recursive(1).\n",
    "Now, count_digits_recursive(1) is called.\n",
    "count_digits_recursive(1) is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "n is 1.\n",
    "Is 1 >= 0 and 1 < 10? Yes! (This is the base case).\n",
    "It return 1. This is the first actual value that gets returned.\n",
    "Returning to count_digits_recursive(12):\n",
    "\n",
    "count_digits_recursive(12) was waiting for count_digits_recursive(1) to return. It received 1.\n",
    "It now calculates 1 + 1, which is 2.\n",
    "It return 2.\n",
    "Returning to count_digits_recursive(123):\n",
    "\n",
    "count_digits_recursive(123) was waiting for count_digits_recursive(12) to return. It received 2.\n",
    "It now calculates 1 + 2, which is 3.\n",
    "It return 3.\n",
    "The final result from the original call count_digits_recursive(123) is 3, which is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Program Structure\n",
    "test_count_digits_recursive(): This function contains several test cases (including 0, single-digit, multi-digit, negative numbers, and large numbers) to ensure the count_digits_recursive function works as expected across different scenarios.\n",
    "main(): This provides an interactive user interface. It prompts the user to enter a number, calls the count_digits_recursive function, and prints the result. It also includes try-except blocks for robust error handling, catching ValueError for non-integer inputs and RecursionError for numbers so large they exceed Python's recursion limit.\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":: This standard Python construct ensures that the test function runs first to verify the code, and then the interactive main function is executed."
